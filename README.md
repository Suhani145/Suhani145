### Overview
I primarily work with **Flutter and Dart**, focusing on understanding how mobile applications are structured, scaled, and maintained beyond beginner-level use cases.

My current work is centered on developing **architectural awareness** — how data flows through an application, how features are layered, and how codebases remain readable and adaptable as they grow.  
I approach this largely through **project-driven learning**: building applications, examining their behavior, refactoring code, and iterating until the system makes sense as a whole.



### Technical Focus
- Flutter & Dart
- MVVM and application-level architecture
- Project structuring and feature layering
- Clean, maintainable code practices
- Navigating and modifying medium-sized Flutter codebases



### Development Direction
- Strengthening core Flutter engineering fundamentals  
- Moving from UI-centric work toward system-aware application design  
- Preparing for future expansion into backend development and native mobile platforms once Flutter proficiency is solid



### Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Dart, C, C++, Python  
- **Frameworks:** Flutter  
- **Tools:** Git, Linux, Postman  
- **Design:** Adobe Illustrator
